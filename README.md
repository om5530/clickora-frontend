# E-commerce Website User Stories

## Project Overview
This document outlines user stories for an e-commerce website designed for a small business. The platform will allow customers to browse products, add them to a cart, place orders, and manage their accounts. Admins will manage products and view orders. The focus is on learning Angular (frontend), Node.js with Express (backend), Sequelize (ORM), and MySQL (database).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The “Add to Cart” button is visible only to logged-in users.
- Adding a product updates the cart in the frontend and backend.
- The cart stores product ID, quantity, and user ID.

- The backend uses Sequelize to store cart items in MySQL.
- The API endpoint is `/api/cart` (POST).

**Tasks:**
- Create an Angular service to manage cart state.
- Update the product details component to include an “Add to Cart” button.
- Set up a Node.js/Express route to add items to the cart.
- Define a Cart model with Sequelize (fields: userId, productId, quantity).

---

### 6. View Shopping Cart
**As a** logged-in customer,  
**I want to** view my shopping cart,  
**so that** I can review items before checkout.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The cart page displays a list of products with name, price, quantity, and total price.
- Users can update quantities or remove items.
- The frontend uses Angular to fetch and display cart items.
- The backend retrieves cart items for the logged-in user.
- The API endpoint is `/api/cart` (GET).

**Tasks:**
- Create an Angular component for the cart page.

## Technical Notes
- **Frontend (Angular):** Use Angular 17+ for components, services, and routing. Implement reactive forms for user input and HttpClient for API communication. Use Angular Material or Bootstrap for UI styling.
- **Backend (Node.js/Express):** Create a RESTful API with Express. Use middleware for authentication (JWT) and error handling. Structure the project with controllers, services, and routes.
- **Database (Sequelize/MySQL):** Define models for User, Product, Cart, Order, and OrderItem. Use Sequelize associations (e.g., User hasMany Orders, Order hasMany OrderItems).
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication for user and admin routes.
- **Learning Focus:** Each user story provides opportunities to practice Angular (UI, routing, services), Node.js/Express (API development), Sequelize (ORM queries, associations), and MySQL (database management).
